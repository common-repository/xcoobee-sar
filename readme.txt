Automate and secure the Subject Access Request Lifecycle in WordPress.

== Description ==

As part of the GDPR (The Right of Access) and CCPA you are required to respond in a timely manner to an individual's requests for access to their data that you store on your systems. A request to access such information is called a Subject Access Request or SAR and as a WordPress website owner you have some very basic tools to manage them.

The XcooBee SAR plugin greatly expands and automates your WordPress SAR response and ensures that you can prove to authorities a proper and timely response.

The plugin matches the users' accounts, automatically aggregates their data and uses secure encrypted delivery to the users via XcooBee messaging. In short, you can safely and quickly respond to SARs without lifting a finger.

You can have the plugin automatically insert a button into your Privacy Policy page and/or use the shortcode provided to copy and paste a SAR Request button option anywhere on your pages, posts, or blogs. 

Just go to plugin's settings page to manage how you wish to enable your users to start the SAR process.

Once the SAR button is clicked, a XcooBee window opens and accepts the basic request and starts tracking. Once the XcooBee network validates the user, a request is passed to your WordPress site where the plugin will automatically extract the user's data and send via secure XcooBee transmission to the user.

In addition, the XcooBee SAR plugin also records the time when users actually download their data that was sent to them. You have a complete record from acceptance to user download. This helps you prove that you responded correctly and expediently to user SAR. You can review this in your WordPress privacy center or in your XcooBee consent administrator. 

Within your XcooBee system account you can also run compliance reports to submit to authorities should there be questions at a later time.


=== pre-requisites ===

For the SAR automation to work correctly:

- The user making a SAR request will need at least a free XcooBee account. They can create one during the request.
- You will need to create a XcooBee professional or higher account. You can test with a free Developer level account.


= Why XcooBee? =

The battle over privacy will be the new frontier in security.

We believe people should have the power to decide what happens to their data and how it is shared. At the same time, business need to have fair use to deliver goods and services. XcooBee's mission is to provide tools to accomplish this and bridge the divide.

This is not only a good vision, but with the advent of the GDPR, a new business requirement.

However, small and medium businesses do not have time to make tools or manage complex software. XcooBee aims to simplify this and make powerful tools available to WordPress sites as well as their customers. Most of these are available for free.
